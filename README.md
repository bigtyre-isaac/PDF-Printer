# PDF Printer

This is a basic Windows command line program to print PDFs. It is based on the PDFium project.

I wrote this for an application which needed to trigger PDF printing server-side from a PHP application. At the time I couldn't find any simple, free way to print a PDF from the command line. It certainly won't handle every printer configuration but it includes basic printing options including printer & tray selection, page size, colour/mono and number of copies.
